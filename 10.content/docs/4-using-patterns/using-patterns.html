# Using Patterns

## What are Patterns for engine4?

I'll admit, engine4 is pretty abstract in some respects and how to use it properly might not be immediately obvious.

Equally, people are often looking for a CMS or Application framework that gives them the basic things (log in, content editing) out of the box.

I always said that engine4 would be just a framework, and it *is*.

**But..**

I also need a way to show off what you can do with this framework with a very small amount of code and very little effort and I need a way to test it with real world scenarios.

So, rather than pollute the framework with functionality and a UI that it *doesn't need*, I have created "patterns". Patterns are small application frameworks that bridge the gap between the framework and a finished project. They also show off what I would consider to be the "best practice" approach to writing engine4 stuff (by which, of course, I mean *my* approach **;-)** ).

So, consider Patterns as a sort of "application template". You can use them in the real world, or you can just use them for reference. They are available either way. If you want to dump them all to keep your framework tight and tiny, just delete the `_e/patterns` folder. No hard feelings.
